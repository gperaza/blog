  abstract = {If we pour spherical beads in a container and then gently shake it to increase the compaction of the system, the packing fraction will converge logarithmically to 0.64, the density of a random close packing. If the system is specially sheared, or tapped through an annealing procedure, lattices may self-organize. In this work we study granular crystallization induced by magnetic cohesion. We observe an interesting granular polymorphism probably due to an effective van der Waals-like interaction.},

  abstract = {An N-component continuous-time dynamic system is considered whose components evolve independently all the time except for discrete asynchronous instances of pairwise interactions. Examples include colliding billiard balls and combat models. A new efficient serial event-driven algorithm is described for simulating such systems. Rather than maintaining and updating the global state of the system, the algorithm tries to examine only essential events, i.e., component interactions. The events are processed in a non-decreasing order of time; new interactions are scheduled on the basis of the examined interactions using preintegrated equations of evolutions of the components. If the components are distributed uniformly enough in the evolution space, so that this space can be subdivided into small sectors such that only O(1) sectors and O(1) components are in the neighborhood of a sector, then the algorithm spends time O(log N) for processing an event which is the asymptotic minimum. The algorithm uses a simple strategy for handling data: only two states are maintained for each simulated component. Fast data access in this strategy assures the practical efficiency of the algorithm. It works noticeably faster than other algorithms proposed for this model.},
